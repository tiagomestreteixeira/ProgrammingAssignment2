## Below are two functions that are used to create a special object 
## that stores a matrix and cache's its inverse.


## makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix", which is really a list containing a function to
## set the value of the matrix
## get the value of the matrix
## set the value of the inverse
## get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    m <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
      x <<- y
      m <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setsolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
    getsolve <- function() m
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setsolve = setsolve,
         getsolve = getsolve)    
}


## The following function calculates the inverse of the special "matrix" 
## created with the above function. However, it first checks to see if 
## the inverse has already been calculated. If so, it gets the inverse from 
## the cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the inverse 
## of the data and sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the setsolve function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$getsolve()
    if(!is.null(m)) {
      message("getting cached matrix")
      return(m)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    m <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setsolve(m)
    m 
}
